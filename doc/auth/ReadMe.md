Setup Authentication / Authorization

The concept is splitted in differen parts:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Identity Provider

All three types can be configured as single service.

### IdentityProvider

To provide indentities one can use the webapplication server to provide that context (in several different ways: WilfFly_Elytron_Secirty https://docs.wildfly.org/26/WildFly_Elytron_Security.html)

There is also the possibility to define within the application which identity provider should be used: (within LDAP config is already another security isssue(ldap protocol not ldaps), ready from database looks like password is saved cleartext(can be configured within authentication setup))

Since the identityprovider part should be delegated, there is no default seup for password hashing, salting. If a identity provider is implemented by the developer himself, he must ensure the hashing by using some encryption frameworks:



### Authentication (JEE specification)

there are different ways how the user has to authenticate:
NONE,
BASIC, => sending cleartext username & password
DIGEST => MD5 Hash of username & password sent, no cleartext password transfer,
FORM, => use Java faces for bindings 
CLIENT-CERT => pre install certificate on the client which the server knows and accepts  


Form based authentication process

## Authorization
Deployment descriptor (can have webapp server depending details web.xml)

Other secure way to delegate Authentication & Authorization by using OpenIdConnect / OAuth:
